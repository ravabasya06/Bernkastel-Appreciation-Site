              ><h1>Frederica Bernkastel</h1>
            </a>
            <p>
              Bernkastel has long, steel-blue hair and emotionless purple eyes.
              Her primary clothing consists of a black and white Gothic Lolita
              dress with a blue ribbon, white cloth socks and black Mary Jane
              shoes. She seems to have a black cat tail with a blue ribbon tied
              on it.
            </p>
            <p>
              Bernkastel initially appears emotionless and gets bored easily.
              She has forgotten the concept of pain and fear after centuries of
              being superior to others. Deep down, Bern is sadistic and willing
              to kill or sacrifice anything or anyone for her own amusement. She
              has a tendency to hold grudges and that even a century won't make
              her forget the humiliation she suffered.
            </p>
            <p>
              Bern can use "magic of miracles" to reset a bad situation, as long
              as the chance of it becoming favourable is not zero. She possesses
              the ability to transform into a cat and to evoke an apparently
              infinite number of cat furniture. She can also manipulate
              Fragments as weapons and transform them into defensive tools.

              href="https://07th-expansion.fandom.com/wiki/Erika_Furudo"

              ><h1>Erika Furudo</h1>
            </a>
            <p>
              Erika has dark blue eyes and hair. Her long hair is in pigtails.
              She wears a fancy pink dress with frills and a white and pink
              canotier with red roses on it.
            </p>
            <p>
              Initially, Erika comes off as a sweet, polite, and soft-spoken
              young lady who is immediately loved and trusted by most of the
              Ushiromiya family soon after washing up on Rokkenjima. But this is
              merely a facade, as Erika is truly an arrogant, sadistic, ruthless
              and cruel woman who cares little for anyone but herself and her
              master Bernkastel. She's highly intelligent and doesn't hesitate
              to use it to lord herself over others.
            </p>
            <p>
              Erika has a photographic memory and practically unlimited stamina.
              She has incredibly heightened senses and is on-par with a tape
              recorder. In End, she uses these powers to climb all over the
              guesthouse in the rain to stick tape on the windows and listens in
              to Battler's room all night. Erika is also able to call people to
              attention and force them to listen to her as an extension of her
              powers.
